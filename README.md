### Data transmission errors: 
    
	Complexity in liquidity management infrastructure introduced heightened risk for potential error. For example, the details of trade executions were fed to various operational systems handling risk management and settlement. A data transmission error within these systems risked causing a delay in trade settlement and access to funding.

### Suboptimal capital management: 
    
	The inability to precisely determine when the institution would receive funding due to uncertainty around settlement timing as well as prolonged delays caused by settlement failure, occasionally led to setbacks in capital deployment, resulting in further stress within operational processes.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
	
	JPMCoin was originally intended for institutional users.  It is believed that these same applications can and will be offered to the average consumer to enjoy the safe and quick transactions without the fees that JPMCoin provides.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
	
	I wouldn’t call it an unfair advantage more than it is a perk of the business they are in... access to the financial system that connects the world.  They process over 10 Trillion dollars in transaction daily.  JPMCoin is up to 1 Billion in transactions a day and they believe it won’t be long before they reach over 10 Billion in transactions a day.  JP Morgan Chase is a clear leader in the financial industry.  They are interwoven in the worldwide financial spiderweb.  With the heavy influence they already have, and their willingness to venture into the world of blockchain transactions and digital currencies, they edge over other banks that are partnering or working with startup companies or cryptocurrency companies.  Onyx *is* JP Morgan Chase.  This gives them a huge advantage.  

	There are some disadvantages to being a global leader in your sector… Umar Farooq, the CEO of Onyx by JPMorgan, said “the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank’s brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start-up. But when products are launched, they reach “a scale that a fintech can only dream of.”

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
	
	They have built a private system off the Ethereum blockchain for JPMCoin.  But JPMCoin has its limits.  The coin allows digital cash movements between JP Morgan Chase accounts only as of now.  Chase has seen this limitation and with the growing capacity for digital currencies, Chase has recently taken their vision to the next level with Partior.  “Partior was cofounded by JP Morgan alongside DBS Bank, Temasek and Standard Chartered. In May JP Morgan received approval to use Partior from the United States’ Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).”

    This has given Chase a huge edge in regards to interbank blockchain networks.  They are currently the only bank allowed to use such networks.  “Partior is designed as a multi bank, multi currency system for wholesale use, with each bank controlling its own node.”

	Although in its infancy, Partior is another evolution in JP Morgan Chase’s venture into blockchain technologies, digital currencies  and the benefits provided by a digital currency platform. 



## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
	
	Chase is a leader in the banking sector, doing over 10 Trillion dollars in transactions a day.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
	
	Blockchain Development, AI, Smart Contracts, Investment Algorythms. All of these elements have completely revolutionized banking as we know it today.  The landscape is is beyond comprehension from just where it was just 20 years ago.  The speed at which these areas are advancing only means that disruption in the banking industry will continue.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
	
	Citi, Bank of America; Other banks jumping on board of “crypto” payments.  Although there are no real direct competitors to Chase at this very moment from any major bank.   Startups like Ripple (XRP) have etched out a niche in their space woth their disruptive platforms.  Ripple (XRP) does lead in their space of mediating interbank transfers using XRP (their cryptocurrency), they are in a different sector of the same space.  They pose zero threat to Chase, Onyx, JPMCoin or any other digital currency venture Chase undertakes. Although... Chase’s heavy investment into the digital currency space may be a warning sign for crypto companies.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    Although JPMCoin may have started out as a novelty, with a few transactions here and there.  The blockchain movement is catching steam and digital currencies are going nowhere.  This is evident with the advancements in usage of the JPMCoin, but also with the development of Onyx and Partior by Chase.  
	

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?  
	
	Money decides the leader in this domain.  The amount of transactions daily in currency.  JP Morgan Chase is the leader in their space at over 10 Tillion dollars in transactions a day.  JPMCoin is doing over 1 Billion in transactions a day and soon they believe they will be over 10 Billion a day.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
	
	I would suggest they offer JPMCoin to their everyday customer.  Digital currency and the safehaven blockchain technology brings is something everyone should be able to have access to.  The safety it provides at a cheaper price should be tapped into by the larger population that could use it most.  This would help the consumer see banks as finally trying to be consumer friendly and transparent vs
